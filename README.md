# Dragino LSN50 & LSN50-v2 LoRa STM32 Source Code
  Repackaged to build with STM32CubeIDE
=============================================================

This is a copy of the repository [LoRa_STM32](https://github.com/dragino/LoRa_STM32) from Dragino. 

The repository contains the sources to build a sample LoRa application for their [LSN50](http://www.dragino.com/products/lora/item/128-lsn50.html) and [LSN50-v2](https://www.dragino.com/products/lora-lorawan-end-node/item/155-lsn50-v2.html).

The code itself is unmodified, it is only adapted for be build with STM32CubeIDE.
Tested this with the LSN50-v2 and STM32CubeIDE 1.12.1.
